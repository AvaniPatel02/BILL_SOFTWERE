# Git Workflow Guide - Push to Branch and Merge to Master

## Current Situation:
- You're on the `master` branch
- You want to push your entire project to your own branch
- Then merge that branch to master

## Step-by-Step Process:

### Step 1: Create and Switch to Your Branch
```bash
# Create a new branch with your name (replace 'your-name' with your actual name)
git checkout -b your-name-branch

# Or if you want to use your current backend24 branch
git checkout backend24
```

### Step 2: Add All Your Project Files
```bash
# Add all files in your project
git add .

# Check what's being added
git status
```

### Step 3: Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add complete project with frontend and backend"
```

### Step 4: Push Your Branch to Remote
```bash
# Push your branch to the remote repository
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Step 5: Merge to Master
```bash
# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Pull latest changes from master
git pull origin master

# Merge your branch into master
git merge your-branch-name

# Push the merged changes to master
git push origin master
```

## Alternative: Use Your Existing Branch

If you want to use your existing `backend24` branch:

```bash
# Switch to your existing branch
git checkout backend24

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Update project with latest changes"

# Push your branch
git push origin backend24

# Switch to master and merge
git checkout master
git merge backend24
git push origin master
```

## Quick Commands Summary:

```bash
# Option 1: Create new branch
git checkout -b your-name-branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add complete project"
git push origin your-name-branch
git checkout master
git merge your-name-branch
git push origin master

# Option 2: Use existing branch
git checkout backend24
git add .
git commit -m "Update project"
git push origin backend24
git checkout master
git merge backend24
git push origin master
```

## Notes:
- This will include your entire project (frontend + backend)
- No build files will be included (they're in .gitignore)
- Your project will be properly version controlled
- You can continue working on your branch for future updates
